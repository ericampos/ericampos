### Hello World!

I am Eric Campos from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Software Developer since 2004. Currently working at [Banco do Brasil](www.bb.com.br), being outsourced by [Capgemini Brazil](www.capgemini.com), as Fullstack Developer using Java 8, AngularJS and ReactJS. Also working on my Front-End Developer career, increasing ReactJS and React Native skills. 

In my free time I like to fish (⚽️), to learn (📚), to meet good old friends (🍺) and to go to historical events with my wife (this includes Victorian costumes and Medieval).
